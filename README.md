This Java project is created to help you prepare for tests, improve your coding skills, and gain a deeper understanding of fundamental programming concepts. 
It contains various methods to solve common programming challenges. 

Currently, only my own implementations are available. Test cases and a project structure for implementing methods on your own will be added soon.
