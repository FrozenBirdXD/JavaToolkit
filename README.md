This Java project is created to help you prepare for exams, improve your coding skills, and gain a better understanding of fundamental programming concepts. 
It contains various methods to solve common programming challenges and empty versions for you to implement yourself, which then can be tested with the provided junit tests.

The challenges are to be solved **without** the use of external libraries or those provided by Java.

### Getting started
1. To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the project directory.
3. The project is structured as follows:
    - `src/solutions/`             -- my implementations
    - `src/your_implementations/`  -- write your solutions here
    - `test/solutions/`            -- tests for my implementations
    - `test/your_implementations/` -- tests for your solutions
4. Implement your solutions in `src/your_implementations/`
5. Run the provided test cases in `test/your_implementations`.
