This Java project is created to help you prepare for exams, improve your coding skills, and gain a better understanding of fundamental programming concepts. 
It contains various methods to solve common programming challenges. 

Currently, only my own implementations (might not be the most efficient) are available. Test cases and a project structure for implementing methods on your own will be added soon.
